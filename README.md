# PythonCanyonScraper
A Python script to scrape the Canyon outlet website and export the bike and prices inside

Scrapes a page like: https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/outlet/road-bikes/?cgid=outlet-road&prefn1=pc_familie&prefn2=pc_outlet&prefn3=pc_rahmengroesse&prefv1=Aeroad&prefv2=true&prefv3=M
outputting the bike name, orig price and sale price, plus a time stamp

It will save to GCP, who knows, maybe it does now.
